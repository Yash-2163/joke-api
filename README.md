# Joke API (Dockerized)

A super simple Node.js + Express app that serves random jokes through a REST API, along with a basic frontend to display them in your browser.

## How to Use

You only need **two commands** to get this running on your system using Docker:

```bash
docker pull yashrajput2163/joke-api
docker run -p 3000:3000 yashrajput2163/joke-api
